## Components

Components are your friends but when should be used cautiously.

### Components home 

**Beware where you create the component.** Once added to file it can not be moved to another one. 

### Deprecating components

Components forgives a lot of mistakes but not all of them. For example, if you need to replace text element the component you will lose the text in all instances. Therefore, in some cases it is better to **deprecate the component** and put new component out. To mark component as deprecates add "[deprecated]" to its name and remove it from the library, this way it will still work for existing uses, but will not be available in library.
