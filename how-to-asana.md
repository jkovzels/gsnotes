# Asana 101

Asana is out main daily driver. We use asana to propose new ideas, work on tasks together, deligate work, ask questions and share results.
We have multiple board and list there, but those 3 are the most impotrant:
1. [Incoming list](https://app.asana.com/0/674910229196621/list): This list is for everything new, exciting, unclear and uncertain. If something is not actionable or with unclear priority it also should live here. 
2. [Backlog board](https://app.asana.com/0/220510979115927/board)
3. [Bugs board](https://app.asana.com/0/341358866037484/board)

## Description

Description of the task is **the single source of truth** about the task. At any given time description should state latest decisions about the task. Description is, in fact, "latest decisions". If something isn't in description it does not exist.

Description usually should be structured around one of the templates. At this point we have to major tempalates: bug and task.

1. Reporter:

4. Done when:


Task template should contain the following:

1. Owner:
