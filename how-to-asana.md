# Asana 101

Asana is out main daily driver. We use asana to propose new ideas, work on tasks together, deligate work, ask questions and share results.
We have multiple board and list there, but those 3 are the most impotrant:
1. [Incoming list](https://app.asana.com/0/674910229196621/list): This list is for everything new, exciting, unclear and uncertain. If something is not actionable or with unclear priority it also should live here. 
2. [Backlog board](https://app.asana.com/0/220510979115927/board): Main design work pipeline. This is where everything happens before it hits Devs Team.
3. [Bugs board](https://app.asana.com/0/341358866037484/board): This one needs no explanation.

## Task Description

Description of the task is **the single source of truth** about the task. At any given time description should state latest decisions about the task. Description is, in fact, "latest decisions". If something isn't in description it does not exist.

Description usually should be structured around one of the templates. At this point we have to major tempalates: bug and task.

Bug template should contain the following:

1. Reporter:
2. Date:
3. Reproducation steps:
4. Done when:


Task template should contain the following:

1. Owner:
2. Goal:
3. Design: [link to figma board]
4. Copywriting: For the most part we will have copy in figma or Doggle doc.
5. Done when: Definition of done.
6. Related: links to related materials and tasks.


# Tags

Tags are usefull tool to give structure, group and classify tasks. Some discipline required to make tags useful. 

Keep tags names short, avoid punctualtion and symbols not easily available on keyboard. Keep them lower case. Tags should be easy to type. 

When using existing tag, make sure that you know it's original meaning and boundaries. For example work 'workout' can mean multiple things in our context: workout as activity or workout the app.
