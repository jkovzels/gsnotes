## Themes

Theme is a promise to solve a problem, not to build a feature. It is intentionally one step removed from something doable. 
It intentionally does not state solution. Theme also does not have due date attached. Theme can exist for extensive period of time (months and years) loosing and gaining priority and severity over time.
