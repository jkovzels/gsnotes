## Themes

Theme is a promise to solve a problem, not to build a feature. It is intentionally one step removed from something doable. 
It intentionally does not state solution. Theme also does not have due date attached. Theme can exist for extensive period of time (months and years) loosing and gaining priority and severity over time.

## OKRs

Stands for "objectives and key results". The technique to "set big, hairy, audacious goals and strategize ways to reach them".
OKRs have due date and can lead to capital punishment if KR are not met.
